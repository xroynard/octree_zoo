[A Survey of Octree Volume Rendering Methods](https://sci.utah.edu/~knolla/octsurvey.pdf)

Some of the OcTree techniques that we could potentially consider include:

- The Morton or Z Order OcTree technique
- The Linear OcTree approach that is most commonly used in computational physics
- The Hashed Octree implementation which uses a hash table to store all nodes in the tree
- The Adaptive OcTree implementation which uses an iterative process to split or merge child nodes based on some criterion (such as node size or homogeneity)
- Bounding Volume Hierarchies which manages spatial subdivisions by organizing primitives into smaller, overlapping regions.
